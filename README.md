# OpenCV-Face-

In this simple project I have tried to make a face, eyes and smile recognition using OpenCV . 
This application is made to run on your system having a web-cam.
It will at real time detect all the above mentioned charateristics and will highlight using a rectangle. 
The parameters used in the functions are purely based on hit and trial or by research and is taken to produce more accurate result.
